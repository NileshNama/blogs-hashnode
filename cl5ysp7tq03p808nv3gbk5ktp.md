## Getting started with Git & GitHub

# Git vs Github
**Git**  is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. **GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.
